The datasets that I have used are available on the following links:

Boston dataset: built-in dataset

SkillCraft1 Master Table Dataset: 
available on the link - 
 http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SkillCraft1+Master+Table+Dataset
The dataset can be downloaded from the Data Folder available on the link. It is a .csv file and can be imported easily into R. This .csv file is also attached for easy import into R.

Individual Household electric power consumption dataset: available on the link - http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption
The dataset can be downloaded from the Data Folder available on the link. The .zip or compressed files have been submitted. This can be extracted, and it gives a .txt file, which was converted into .csv file for importing it into R. Since, it is a big dataset, only a subset of the data can be used for prediction.

•	Import the datasets into R 

•	Run the scripts using the command source("file.r")
